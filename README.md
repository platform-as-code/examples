# Platform as Code examples

## Introduction

You will find in this repository examples of source code to configure our platform.

## Examples

[hello-world](https://github.com/platform-as-code/examples/tree/main/hello-world): This is the most basic example, just an index.html file with H1 tag "Hello World". If you push this example to our platform, the system will auto-detect the right runtime, in this case static HTML. After deployment, you will see a beautiful "Hello world" in your browser on a fresh environment.
